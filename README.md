# Flipping-Memory-Game

A simple and fun memory game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. The game ends when all pairs are matched. This is a great beginner project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic using JavaScript.

## Features
- **Grid Layout**: The game is played on a 4x4 grid of cards (16 cards in total).
- **Card Flipping**: Cards are flipped when clicked, showing their value.
- **Matching Logic**: If two flipped cards match, they stay flipped. If they donâ€™t, they are flipped back after a short delay.
- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all pairs are matched.
- **Reset Game**: The player can reset the game with the click of a button.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game board and the layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game cards, layout, and user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, including handling user interactions and card matching.

## How to Play
1. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its value.
2. Try to find a matching pair by flipping over two cards at a time.
3. If the two flipped cards match, they stay face up.
4. If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
5. Continue until all cards have been matched.
6. Press the "Reset Game" button to restart the game.
